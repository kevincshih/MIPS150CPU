    Number used as Flip Flops:                  16
    Number used as Latch-thrus:                  1
  Number of Slice LUTs:                         84 out of  69,120    1%
    Number used as logic:                       83 out of  69,120    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              68
      Number using O5 output only:              14
      Number using O5 and O6:                    1
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         1
  Number of route-thrus:                        15
    Number using O6 output only:                15

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    30 out of  17,280    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           84
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            67 out of      84   79%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of      84    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          17 out of      84   20%
    Number of unique control sets:               1
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               0 out of  69,120    0%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        22 out of     640    3%
    Number of LOCed IOBs:                       16 out of      22   72%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        1

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.38
